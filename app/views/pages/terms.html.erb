    <div>
      <p>This StrollnSmile Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is a contract
      between StrollnSmile, LLC. (“StrollnSmile” or “we”) and the person(s) that
      are registered with StrollnSmile (“user” or “you”). This Agreement
      describes the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the
      StrollnSmile marketplace to book or list dentals or other dentals services
      through our website or apps, and governs your dental for other users; and
      establishes the obligations owed between you and StrollnSmile, and between
      you and other users.</p>

      <p>Throughout this Agreement, the term “Service” means the service
      allowing you to book dental or offer your dental and dental services to
      others through our website or apps (the “Platform”). The term Service does
      not include any services provided by third parties.</p>

      <p>A “Dental” is the physical space or dental that is made available to
      any person to use during specific times, and subject to specific Fees and
      any site-specific terms or limitations. A dental may “List” a dental by
      providing certain details about the dental including availability,
      pricing, and terms or limitations of use; this posting about a dental is
      called a “Listing.”</p>

      <p>A person may “Book” a dental appoinment by accepting the times, fees,
      and any additional services or limitations of the Listing. A “Booking” is
      (i) only the grant of a limited, temporary, revocable license to use a
      dental, and (ii) if applicable, a contract for dental Services, in the
      manner, for the time, and subject to all restrictions provided, subject to
      this Agreement, and as confirmed through the Platform. The scope of the
      use, including times, specific fees, and other additional terms or
      limitations, constitutes a “Booking Agreement” that incorporates the terms
      and conditions of this Agreement and referenced policies.</p>

      <p>If you have questions about this Agreement, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:">strollnsmile@gmail.com</a> Your use of the Platform or
      Services constitutes your ongoing acceptance of this Agreement, as
      amended.</p>
